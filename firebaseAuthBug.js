The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful sign-in. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your application relies on the user's authentication state to load data or render UI elements.  The user may appear to be logged out for a short period even though they've authenticated successfully. This is often coupled with a lack of error handling leading to a confusing experience for the user and difficulty debugging.
